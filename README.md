## Set up Github

1) Create a Github account

2) Download and install Git
  - Download Git for Windows
    - Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
    - NOTE: Your download should start automatically
  - Find the above file in your "Downloads" folder and double-click on it
  - In the install wizard:
    - When you get to the "Adjusting your PATH environment", select "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt"
    - When you get to "Configure the line ending converstions", select "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings"
    - When you get to "Configure the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash", select "Use Windows's default console window"

4) Close your command prompt window and open a new one; go back to the folder you were in

5) Generate an SSH Key
  - ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  - NOTE: Press enter again and again to accept all of the default options

6) Add the above SSH Key to your Github account (in account settings)
  - Go to the C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.ssh folder
  - notepad id_rsa.pub
  - Copy the entire file
  - In account settings, under SSH and GPG keys, click "New SSH key"
  - Paste the key into the "Key" textarea

## Set up the local server and repository for the help documentation

1) Download and install Node.js
  - Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  - Download the Windows 64-bit version

2) Download and install Ruby
  - Go to https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
  - Download the latest version of the x64 -- as of this writing, Ruby 2.3.3 (x64)
  - Find the above file in your "Downloads" folder and double-click on it
  - Select "Add Ruby executables to your PATH"

3) Download and install Ruby Development Kit
  - Go to https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
  - Find the download links under "Development Kit"
  - Download the one under "For use with Ruby 2.0 and above (x64 - 64bits only)" -- as of this writing, "DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe"
  - Find the above file in your "Downloads" folder and double-click on it (it is a self-extracting .exe file) -- NOTE: For the path, make sure to extract it to a specific folder like "c:\ruby-dev-kit" (if you don't, you'll end up with a bunch of cruft in whatever directory you extract it).
  - NOTE: Ruby will need the dev kit in the future, so be sure not to delete it.
