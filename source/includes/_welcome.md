# Welcome

Thanks for stopping by! This getting started guide will get you building and running pipes with Flex.io.  It'll also introduce you to the command line and API.  From there, we'll point you to the [docs]((https://www.flex.io/docs/)) and our [support team](#getting-further-help) to help you on your way.

---

**Flex.io enables you to build and run cloud-based pipes.**  

Simply put, a pipe does the following:

* Gathers data and files from **input(s)**
* Performs a series of **operations** on the input(s)
* Pushes the transformed data and files to **ouput(s)**


Once you've built a pipe, you can run it manually from within the application, from the command line or from an API. Pipes can also be scheduled from the web app and you may also run pipes that have been shared with you by others.

In this getting started guide, we'll show you how to:

* [Run an existing pipe]() TODO;
* [Build and run a new pipe]()
* [Run a pipe from the command line]()
* [Run a pipe from an API]()

When you're ready to start building pipes, here are some handy reference guides:

* [Web app docs](https://www.flex.io/docs/web-app/).  Reference for the web app, including syntax for [command operations](https://www.flex.io/docs/web-app/#command-bar-operations) and [functions](https://www.flex.io/docs/web-app/#functions-and-syntax).
* [API reference](https://www.flex.io/docs/api/). Reference for the API, including authentication, parameters and errors.
* [Command line interface (CLI)]() TODO;
* [Documentation portal](https://www.flex.io/docs/). The central portal for all Flex.io docs and support.


Along the way, we're here to help, so please [contact us](#getting-further-help) if you have questions, feedback or ideas.

Let's jump in!
