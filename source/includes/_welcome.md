# Welcome to Flex.io

Flex.io is a handy web service for building cloud-based data pipes you can use to hack your data busywork.  Using Flex.io, you can set up a range of simple data integrations in cases where you might need to add a bit of data processing glue:

* Transfer files selectively between cloud storage services
* Connect and transform data between APIs
* Add data-driven web elements to a static web page

This is a guide to show you around the application and help you get started building and using pipes.
