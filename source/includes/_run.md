If the pipe is public, you can open the pipe and run it directly; if a pipe is private, you have to sign in to your account to run it.

##### Run a public pipe:

1. Open the [Contact Refinement sample pipe]().  TODO;
2. Click the Run Pipe button at the top-right.

When the pipe is running, you'll see a series of status bars showing the progress.  Then, when the pipe is finished, you'll see the result below the pipe steps.  You can click on any step to see command and corresponding output for that given step.
